Based on the number of copies available the following rules is put into consideration.

 - If the borrowers are both staff, a staff that has an older registration date will have higher precedence to the newer.
 - If the borrowers are both student, a student that has an older registration date will have higher precedence to the newer.
 - A staff will have higher precedence over a student.
